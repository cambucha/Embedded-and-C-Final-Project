# Embedded-and-C-Final-Project
Final Project - Embedded and C course - EVBplus HCS12 development board - Dragon12

This project mimicked a microwave. I wrote the main.c program, which utilized built-in tools and header files given from the course.
The IDE used was codewarrior.
Here is a link to the development board that was used for this course: http://www.evbplus.com/9s12/9s12_hcs12.html
